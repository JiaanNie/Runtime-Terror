### Project Description: 
In modern society, travelers have a lot of photos that they have taken over the years on their vacations. Having so many fond memories compounding in their photo albums gets overwhelming over time. Where was this photo taken? Why was this structure so important at the time? what can I do to organize my collections?

### Project Vision: 
Create an easy to use way to organize photo collections into albums using the data provided in the image pixels to find landmarks within the images, then grouping similar images into smaller collections for the user.
