#### Transcript completed 
  Hello, we are Runtime Terror. Imagine a scenario where you either find a photo from your own collection or find a photo scrolling through social media platforms and ask yourself where was this photo taken? Our objective is to create a software Product accessible to everyone to allow the user to identify landmarks in their photos. This will help the user self organize, and catalog their photo collections. We would like to achieve this using machine learning and data provided by Google. 

Introductions & responsibilities:
 1) Wilson - ML, Backend, Frontend
 2) Allan - ML
 3) Ali - Frontend, Backend
 4) Sopuru - Frontend, Backend

  Our hopes for the future of this project is to create an open source service hosted online so that the public can use it, and that can eventually be integrated into social media platforms where it can be used to automatically tag landmarks in photos uploaded by people. The business 'need' is that this service would provide a quality of life improvement through a convenience.

Some constraints that we foresee will likely impact the progress in this project; 
  Knowledge - our team has limited background in machine learning, and deep learning which will require a large amount of time spent by the group researching

  Technology - this type of project will require large amounts of computational power & time
  
Assumptions: The data sourced for training and testing our model is mostly clean

  This idea was inspired by the Kaggle Competition: Google landmark recognition 2020. We chose this project in particular because although the idea of identifying landmarks is rather narrow, the skill sets we will learn accomplishing this will have a wide range of applications in identifying objects, people, etc. The main deciding factor in us choosing this project is that we thought it would be different, fun learning experience, and we wanted to challenge ourselves with handling large quantities of data.
